		<p><strong>Why Isn T My Live Wallpaper Working Iphone 7</strong>. Live Wallpapers are a feature of 3D Touch which is exclusive to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. There may be some background apps or programs causing the problem of animated wallpaper not working. While Haptic isnt too much slower theres other features I miss such as being able to peek into a link and press harder to open. Therefore if the 3D Touch not working or you have disabled it the live wallpaper wont display correctly.</p>
